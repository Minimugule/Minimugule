## Statistic Projects

### _Craf beer around Rennes (R)_([link to project repository](https://github.com/Minimugule/OptimalLocationCraftBeer))
**Summary** : This R project analyzes the optimal location for establishing a craft beer cellar around Rennes, using demographic, economic, and geographic data. It employs spatial statistical methods to identify the best site and select a suitable brand. The data is sourced from the French governmentâ€™s SIRENE database and geographic IRIS information.

### _Road accidennts in Rennes (Python)_([link to project repository](https://github.com/Minimugule/AnalyzesRoadAccidents))
**Summary** : This Python project analyzes road accidents using the pandas and bokeh libraries for data visualization. It processes accident data by splitting date and time, sorting the dataset, and mapping specific vehicle types to broader categories (e.g., car, motorcycle, heavy vehicle). The project aims to visualize accident trends and categorize accident types for better insights.
